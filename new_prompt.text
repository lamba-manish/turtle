I'm developing a FastAPI-based trading alert system using SQLite and ICICI Breeze API. 
Follow the cursorrules and user rules, you have already been provided cursorrules and user rules.
Follow these project rules:

Use FastAPI, uv (not pip), SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Alembic.

Store constants, sensitive data and log levels in app/config.py.

Use SQLite in app/database/trading_alerts.db.

All logs must be saved locally in:
app/logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}/[info|error|request]/

Include a unique request_id for every request, added via middleware.

Log:

Incoming requests and outgoing responses under request/

Business/operational info under info/

Exceptions under error/

The log level must be controlled from config.py

Use Pydantic for schemas, routers/ for endpoints, services/ for business logic.

Code must be Pythonic, type-annotated, readable, and production-scalable.
